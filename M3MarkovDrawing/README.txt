First-Order Markov Chain Halo Map Generator

To successfully set up this code. The python file must be in the same folder as the training images. I utilized absolute path to reference the folder the images were in so that will need to change if you were to run it. Beyond that, you can simply just run it by typing “python3 markovDistinction.py” into the terminal command line.

This system is broken down into two different functions. The first function deals with setting up the probabilities for the second function to use to construct the new image. The first function, taking a training image as an argument, loops through every pixel in the image, and stores their RGB values into a list. That list is then looped through, putting these elements into a dictionary where the current value is put in as the key and the immediate next element is put in as the value within a list. If the initial element already exists as a key, the following element is appended to the values list. This creates a dictionary of every pixel’s RGB value as a key to a list of all the succeeding pixel RBG values. In the second function, we take this dictionary to populate a created blank Image object. First, we have been tracking a list of every pixel’s RGB value that’s been present in the images we have used to train. This gives us a starting probability and we randomly select one RGB value to be the first pixel’s color. We then use that RGB value to continue the coloring of the rest of the pixels, by randomly selecting a RGB value from the list provided by the Markov Chain dictionary when using the previous pixel’s RGB value as the key. Essentially, the next color of the pixel is determined by the probability of that color given the previous pixel’s color. We loop through all of the training images to create the starting probabilities list and Markov chain dictionary before generating our own image.

This system is personally meaningful to me because Halo 3 was one of the first video games I’ve ever seriously played. I’ve spent countless hours playing the campaign on my own and multiplayer with my friends, collecting a ton of memories along the way. So when I was deciding what to focus on when creating a visual art piece, I knew reaching back to Halo 3 maps was a no brainer for me. The Halo 3 maps all carry a sense of heroism on an epic scale providing a cool basis on a new visual art attempt.

Initially, this system was a daunting one to consider. I think I have a negative tendency to think that these type of assignments that involve tangible things like images suddenly are massive tasks and it’s tough for me to get started. Not to say that this wasn’t a hard task, but it fortunately wasn’t as bad as I thought it’d be. As a computer scientist, the challenging part consisted of using the module pillow for the first time and trying to actually apply the theory of Markov Chains that we learned and read about. Utilizing the documentation page was helpful practice because I’m sure there are tons of modules out there that I’ve never even heard of. Making the connection from theory to application has always been difficult for me, because I know what I’m supposed to do, but putting it into practical use is always difficult. In this case, it was helpful to look at an example and also try to break down the idea in smaller components and think in each step, what exactly am I trying to do here? So this challenge was important one to get the ball rolling in how I think for the semester. The next step for me is to continue with this type of thinking for problems in the future because applying theory to practice is something that will never stop.

I don’t think my system is creative, because my system doesn’t fully exhibit all of the traits(novelty, value and intentionality) for a system to be computationally creative. I don’t think the approach I made is some groundbreaking method. The system does have value to me, however, and I think the practice and attempt I made in generating a piece of art was valuable both for the product and the practice. The system also has intentionality, as the goal I had in mind was to create a visual piece.
